# Welcome to the Embedded Sharepoint Documentation

Welcome to the Embedded Sharepoint! Embedded-Sharepoint contains the shared embedded files to build and develop for our custom STM32 PCBs.

In PowerShell administrator: 

    usbipd list
    usbipd bind --busid <busid>
    usbipd attach --wsl --busid <busid>


## Porting

A valid port of an STM requires three things:

1. A directory under stm/stm32f4xx or stm/stm32l4xx must be generated with the generic name of the microcontroller. This is typically stm32 followed by four characters specifying the series and line (stm32f413, stm32l431, etc.)
2. A linker script under the aforementioned directory. This can be autogenerated by STM32CubeMX or grabbed from the internet. The name should take the form of STM32*_FLASH.ld, and should include the full name of the processor (STM32F413RHTx_FLASH.ld, STM32L431CBTx_FLASH.ld, etc.)
3. A startup assembly file including the vector table and some basic handlers (most important being Reset_Handler). This can be autogenerated by STM32CubeMX or grabbed from the internet. The name should take the form of startup_stm32 followed by the four characters specifying the series and line and then xx (startup_stm32f413xx.s, startup_stm32l431xx.s)

The Makefile will expect this exact naming structure, so please ensure you've set it up properly. If everything goes to plan, you should be able to build with PROJECT_TARGET set to the full name of the port.
