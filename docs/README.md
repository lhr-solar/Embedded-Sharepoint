# Welcome to the Embedded Sharepoint Documentation

Welcome to the Embedded Sharepoint! This documentation is designed to assist LHR - Solar teams in developing projects using STM32 devices.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Development:** Provides a unified interface for working with various STM32 devices.
- **Modular Design:** Easily integrate with different components and libraries.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed guides and API references for every module.

## WSL

### USB PassThrough

#### Install USBIPD (only need to do this the first time)

In Powershell administrator:
    
    winget install usbipd

#### Pass USB Devices

In PowerShell administrator: 

    usbipd list
    usbipd bind --busid <busid>
    usbipd attach --wsl --busid <busid>

## Setup

Note: Docker installs tools for development on Ubuntu 22.04.

Note: DO NOT install packages in the docker session. Changes will be lost. Update the Dockerfile instead!

Note: If USB devices are detected via lsusb but fail to open, try restarting the container with the device plugged in.

### VS Code

Install Dev Containers extension

Open repository folder in VS Code

F1 â†’ "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..."

Ensure docker is running
    
    sudo systemctl start docker

### CLI Script

This script sets up a docker container for embedded development.

Usage:

    ./start.sh

Remove Docker Image:

    docker rmi embedded-sharepoint-dev

## Porting

A valid port of an STM requires three things:

1. A directory under stm/stm32f4xx or stm/stm32l4xx must be generated with the generic name of the microcontroller. This is typically stm32 followed by four characters specifying the series and line (stm32f413, stm32l431, etc.)
2. A linker script under the aforementioned directory. This can be autogenerated by STM32CubeMX or grabbed from the internet. The name should take the form of STM32*_FLASH.ld, and should include the full name of the processor (STM32F413RHTx_FLASH.ld, STM32L431CBTx_FLASH.ld, etc.)
3. A startup assembly file including the vector table and some basic handlers (most important being Reset_Handler). This can be autogenerated by STM32CubeMX or grabbed from the internet. The name should take the form of startup_stm32 followed by the four characters specifying the series and line and then xx (startup_stm32f413xx.s, startup_stm32l431xx.s)

The Makefile will expect this exact naming structure, so please ensure you've set it up properly.
