## WSL

### USB PassThrough

#### Install USBIPD (only need to do this the first time)

In Powershell administrator:
    
    winget install usbipd

#### Pass USB Devices

In PowerShell administrator: 

    usbipd list
    usbipd bind --busid <busid>
    usbipd attach --wsl --busid <busid>

## Setup

Note: Docker installs tools for development on Ubuntu 22.04.

Note: DO NOT install packages in the docker session. Changes will be lost. Update the Dockerfile instead!

Note: If USB devices are detected via lsusb but fail to open, try restarting the container with the device plugged in.

### VS Code

Install Dev Containers extension

Open repository folder in VS Code

F1 â†’ "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..."

Ensure docker is running
    
    sudo systemctl start docker

### CLI Script

This script sets up a docker container for embedded development.

Usage:

    ./start.sh

Remove Docker Image:

    docker rmi embedded-sharepoint-dev
