 * @brief Header file for describing CAN message queues.
 *
 * @details
 * This file defines macros for handling CAN message queues, specifying message ID,
 * buffer size, and whether the queue is circular. It is auto-generated by dbc-to-c.py,
 * and any modifications should be made in the DBC file to ensure consistency.
 *
 * Macros defined in this file follow the format:
 *
 *   CAN_RECV_ENTRY(message_id, buffer_size, circular)
 *
 * Where:
 * - message_id: The identifier for the CAN message.
 * - buffer_size: The size of the receive buffer.
 * - circular: Indicates if the buffer operates in a circular manner.
 *
 * For more details, refer to the BSP CAN header files.
