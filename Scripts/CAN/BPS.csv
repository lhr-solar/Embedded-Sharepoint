Data,CAN ID,Length(bytes),Index Used,IN/OUT,Description
BPS Trip,0x002,1,0,,"Precision: 1 bit
Data: 1 - bps tripped, something is wrong
0 - bps has not tripped. Could either be battery pack is safe or bps
is currently determing if the battery pack is safe. (This is arbitrary though)
Frequency: Only sends when tripped
Notes: Whenever tripped, the bps will sequentially send out every CAN
message related to the BPS from BPS trip to CAN Error. The bps will not periodically send 0 for BPS trip on the CAN line. The act of sending the BPS trip CAN ID itself should alarm all systems that it tripped"
BPS All Clear,0x101,1,0,,"Precision: 1 bit
Data: 1 - for everything is running and safe
0 - for not clear. Could either mean the bps hasn't finished
diagnostics on battery pack or the bps tripped
Frequency: Only on startup"
BPS Contactor State,0x102,1,0,,"Precision: 3 bits
Data: 
000 - All BPS contactors are open
001 - HV Plus/Minus BPS Contactors are open, HV Array Contactor is closed
110 - HV Plus/Minus BPS Contactors are closed, HV Array Contactor is open
111 - All BPS contactors are closed
Frequency: Medium - 2 Hz
Notes: The least significant bit (bit 0) is associated with the Array BPS Contactor, 
and bits 1 and 2 are associated with the HV Minus and Plus Contactors."
Current Data,0x103,4,0,,"Type: Fixed Point
Typical Range: -20000mA to 55000mA (-20000 to 100000mA min/max) 
Frequency: Medium - periodically sent at certain frequency. Maybe 1-5 Hz"
Voltage Data array,0x104,5,1,,"Type: unisgned 8bit idx + word (fixed point) (4 bytes)
Frequency: Medium - periodically sent at certain frequency. Maybe 1-5 Hz"
Temperature Data array,0x105,5,1,,"Type: unisgned 8bit idx + word (fixed point) (4 bytes)
Frequency: Medium - periodically sent at certain frequency. Maybe 1-5 Hz"
State of Charge Data,0x106,4,0,,"Type: Decimal Fixed point, 6 digit decimal precision
Typical Range: 0-100.00%
Frequency: Medium - periodically sent at certain frequency. Maybe 5 Hz
the display may need this data as well."
WDog Triggered,0x107,1,0,,"Precision: 1 bit
Data: 1 - watchdog tripped
0 - watchdog has not tripped
Frequency: Low - only sent if it happens"
CAN Error,0x108,1,0,,"Precision: 1 bit
Data: 1 - CAN error. Message might have been missed or error in format
0 - all good
Frequency: Low - only sent if it happens"
BPS Command msg,0x109,8,0,,"In case a system wants to communicate with the BPS, use this ID"
Supplemental Voltage,0x10B,2,0,,"Type: Integer with units of millivolts
Typical Range: 6V to 15V
Frequency: Medium - periodically sent at certain frequency. Maybe 1-5 Hz"
Charging Enabled,0x10C,1,0,,"Precision: 1 bit
Data: 0 - charging disabled, 1 - charging enabled
Frequency: Same as Temperature Data Array (1-5 Hz)
Notes: This is a suggestion to Array and Controls on whether or not they should supply power to the battery. If the suggestion is not followed, the BPS may trip"
Voltage Summary,0x10D,8,0,,"uint24 pack voltage in mV, uint24 voltage range in mV, uint16 milliseconds since last voltage update: all little endian. 30 Hz"
Temperature Summary,0x10E,8,0,,"int24 average temp in millicelsius, int24 temp range in millicelsius, uint16 milliseconds since last temp update: all little endian 30 Hz"
